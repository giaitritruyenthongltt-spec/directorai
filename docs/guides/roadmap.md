\* P1 retag covers the move from mock-only to server↔panel proxy + real UXP adapter.
Text overlay (P1.17) and transitions (P1.18) are intentionally deferred — see
`KNOWN-LIMITATION` notes in `packages/premiere-adapter/src/uxp.ts`.

\*\*\* P3 retag adds Plan Executor, LLM-assisted refiner, Style Learner (diff
capture + pattern extraction + feedback), versioning + .style import/export,
60-preset effect library, panel Style editor with Plan/Dry-Run/Apply flow, and a
9-test E2E suite. Visual YAML form-builder (P3.17 ideal version) is shipped as a
working text editor with JSON context — full form controls deferred to P4 polish.

\*\* P2 retag adds embeddings + ChromaDB, the `context.*` RPC namespace, the panel
Context tab, and 16-test pytest suite covering the ingest pipeline. Job queue
(P2.14) deliberately deferred — current ingest is sync but cached; revisit when
batch indexing latency becomes a UX problem.

## What changed at `v0.2.1-control-live`

- `UXPPremiereAdapter` calls the real `premierepro` UXP module (apiVersion 2)
  using `project.lockedAccess()` for automatic undo grouping per mutation.
- `RemotePremiereAdapter` forwards every IPremiereAdapter method to a
  pluggable send fn, used by the Node server to proxy MCP/Claude Desktop
  calls into the connected UXP panel.
- WS server tracks the active panel socket, exposes `panelCall()` and
  `isPanelConnected()`; falls back to the local mock when no panel is
  registered so dev/CI keeps working without Premiere open.
- Panel ws-client sends `_panel.register` handshake on connect, handles
  inbound RPC via the shared dispatcher, adds exponential-backoff
  reconnect and 25-second heartbeat.
- Dispatcher auto-brackets every mutating call in a `beginUndoGroup`/
  `endUndoGroup` pair and runs each call through an exponential retry
  on transient errors (timeouts, scene busy, ECONNRESET, …).
- `nl.query` RPC method runs an Anthropic tool-use agent loop over all
  29 Premiere tools — the panel's free-text command bar uses it when
  the input doesn't match a built-in shortcut.
- 14-test integration suite exercises every tool group through the
  full dispatcher.

Each macro-phase ends with a **MILESTONE** — full regression test +
tag + ADR. See [`docs/adr/`](../adr/) for accepted architectural
decisions.
